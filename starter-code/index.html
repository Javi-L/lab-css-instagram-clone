  <h1>Capture and Share the World's Moments</h1>

  <pre>Instagram is a <strong>fast, beautiful</strong> and <strong>fun</strong> way to share your life with friends and family.

  Take a picture or video, choose a filter to transform its look and feel, then post to Instagram &mdash; it's that easy. You can even share to Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr and more. It's a new way to see the world.

  Oh yeah, did we mention it's free?</pre>
